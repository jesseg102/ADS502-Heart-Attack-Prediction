#### Project Intro/Objective

The main purpose of this project is to generate a classification model to classify individuals' heart attack risk into one of two categories: low-risk or high-risk. This model can then be used to alert individuals who are high-risk, so they can begin taking preventative measures to reduce their risk. The goal is to obtain high accuracy while optimizing sensitivity. We want to reduce the number of false negatives, as predicting heart attack risk is relatively high stakes and we want to ensure that high-risk patients are classified correctly so they can take preventative measures.

#### Project Description
This analysis uses demographic and health data from patients who have and have not had a heart attack. The data was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). There were a total of 303 observations and 14 features. We wanted to find which features provide the most insight into heart attack risk, through data exploration and by testing out various combinations of inputs into six different types of classification models: CART, C5.0, Logistic Regression , Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network. The models were then evaluated, and ideal potential models were identified. One limitation was the size of the dataset; 303 observations is a very small sample size. Therefore, we recommend that our analysis is validated with a more comprehensive dataset.
